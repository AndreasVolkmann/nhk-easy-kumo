A web crawler to fetch today's top news articles from [the NHK easy page](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/).

I built this so that I can easily import the articles into LingQ, including the image and audio. 

Here are the courses containing them: 
* [NHK Easy 2017年・春夏](https://www.me.avo.kumo.lingq.com/learn/ja/web/#/course/266730)
* [NHK Easy 2017年・秋冬](https://www.me.avo.kumo.lingq.com/learn/ja/web/#/course/293928)

The program relies on the [Selenium Chrome Driver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) which needs to be in the root project directory.
Therefore, it cannot be run by a headless server.

NHK-kumo is also responsible for other courses:
* [JLPT N2 Grammar Course](https://www.me.avo.kumo.lingq.com/learn/ja/web/#/course/274307)
