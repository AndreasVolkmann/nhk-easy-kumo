# NHK Easy 蜘蛛
A web crawler to fetch today's top news articles from [the NHK easy page](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/).

I built this so that I can easily import the articles into LingQ, including the image and audio. 

Here is the course containing them: [NHK Easy LingQ Course](https://www.lingq.com/learn/ja/web/#/course/266730)

The program is also responsible for other courses:
* [JLPT N2 Grammar Course](https://www.lingq.com/learn/ja/web/#/course/274307)


More to come ...
